# NavierStokes-finite-element

## About
Using the [Freefem++](https://freefem.org/) kernel, this code solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations involving a first order time scheme based on the characteristics method and a spatial discretization of finite element type.

## Compiling

Follow instruction in the makefile, basically you need suitesparse to be installed in your system.


## Results
All details, including the problem solved and all the tests performed, are available in the file __Rapport.pdf__.
